        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">ADMISSION TO SECONDARY</h1>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4 mb-10 lg:mt-4">
            DHIU enrolls only intelligent and talented students aged below 11½ who have completed or are 
            completing their five-year primary education provided at formal schools and recognized local Madrasas. 
            Admission to the university campus/affiliated colleges is based only on merit and intellectual 
            potential of students that are evaluated through standard oral and written entrance tests. 
            This is because, DHIU believes that only bright and intelligent students will be capable to 
            pursue the extensive curricula adopted by DHIU. The calls for applications are made in the 
            Arabic month of Sha’ban every year, while the entrance tests are held in the first week of Shawwal. 
            The University offers a continuous stream of twelve-year course, starting from Secondary until 
            Post Graduation. Therefore, it does not allow fresh admissions to higher levels.
