            Nahjurrashad Islamic College is an academic juncture between Islamic and modern forms of 
            education which follows the syllabus of Darul Huda Islamic University, Chemmad. Accordingly, 
            NRIC aims to educate and prepare capable, intellectual and spiritual Islamic scholars, who 
            can handle both the religious and secular issues, which the time demands. It also ensures 
            the academic excellence in Islamic learning, teaching, research and publications. NRIC is founded upon the educational philosophy of Islam which 
            in turn is inspired by the principles of hierarchy and unity of knowledge in its intents and methods. So, we recognize that the 
            knowledge should be acquired internalized and propagated for the sake of Allah the almighty. 
            This booklet will guide you through the educational philosophy, vision and mission; and various 
            academic programs by the institution.
