                        philosophy of Islam. Within more than 15 years, it has changed the perception of Islamic education in 
                        India and has set a new positive trend to follow. Many intellectuals and organizations acknowledged the 
                        achievement of NRIC, are willingly adopting the same philosophy of education.</p>
